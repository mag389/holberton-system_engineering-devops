# Application servers

an application can be thought of as akin to a web server, but instead of serving web pages
or static data, an application server delivers dynamic content, usually interactable.

In the case of this project the dynamic content takes the form of an Airbnb clone running on a server.

For this project I use the Gunicorn application server program.`
