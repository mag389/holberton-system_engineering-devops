Finally actually setting up the primary/replica (master/slave) 
to do this we edit the mysql config files found in the servers at
/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
for server 1:
holberton didn't want us to use the bind address conditional so we comment that out
(bind address is line 43)

then we have to uncomment the server-id: this must be unique, but we only have 2 servers 
so we'll go with server 1 (line 83)

uncomment lin 'log_bin                 = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log'
roughly line 84
that's where slave copies from basically

finallly designte the db that will be replicated on the slave server
change the binlog_do_db = ... line
from
#binlog_do_db            = include_database_name
to
binlog_do_db             = tyrell_corp

from there we move on to changin things in sql or the other server:
restart mysql: 'sudo service mysql restart'
get master stats of db: 'sudo mysql -uroot', 'use tyrell_corp;', 'SHOW MASTER STATUS;'
that will give info about the master such as position (154 for me)

Then we're good to move onto the slave DB:
first is to again change configuration of /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
for replica we do use bind address: to 35.243.199.170 line 43
server-id = 2 (line 83)
uncomment log bin (line 84):
uncomment binlog_do_db (line 87) and change db to tyrell_corp
	binlog_do_db            = tyrell_corp
add line 'relay-log               = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log'
	(i did line 88)

THen it's onto the mysql portion:
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='35.227.79.31',MASTER_USER='replica_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='deckard', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000005', MASTER_LOG_POS=  1272;
START SLAVE;

then it shold be good check with 'SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G' (\G for readability
