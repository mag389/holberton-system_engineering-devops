The purpose of this project is primary-replica databse synchronization
to do that we need one last thing:
on the primary server (web-01, 35.227.79.31)
we create a new user for the replica server
to do so:
enter mysql: 'sudo mysql -uroot -hlocalhost'
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'replica_user'@'%';
# SET PASSWORD FOR 'replica_user'@'%' = 'deckard';
(i didn't set up a password for now)

the replica user must be able to replicate
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';

holbertonuser needs to chekc user info for this task
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost';
