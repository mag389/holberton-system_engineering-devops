The first task is to install mysql 5.7.x on the two web servers
first get into the web servers with:
'ssh ubuntu@35.227.79.31'
and
'ssh ubuntu@35.243.199.170'
those are web servers 01 and 02 (private key is stored in a file)
see project 0x0B-ssh for more details

then once on each server

sudo apt install mysql-server
(use 'sudo apt install -y mysql-server' for ease)

you can check installation with 'mysql --version'

it may ask password when entering mysql. you can void that by using sudo
i.e. 'sudo mysql -uroot -hlocalhost'
alternatively in the file /etc/mysql/debian.cnf it hsould contain that info

you can check users with:
SELECT user FROM mysql.user;
to see all users. even better is 
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
although they all start off with just localhost

that is all the tasks to be done, but the checker wants more.
Currently the checker only has access to one of the servers,
we have to add their key to the other server. that is 0x0B task 3

to do so imply add the new public key to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
once that's done you get all checks
